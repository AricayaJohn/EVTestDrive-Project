### Step 1 : Coming up with an idea
    * When shopping for a new car there are plenty of options to choose from.
    * As a person that is interested on new tech and cars I want to have the user to get informations about the Electriv vehicles and their qualities 
    * I want the user to also have the chance to randomly pick a car incase they could not choose which car to test drive 

### Step 2: Features
    * I want to have a title in the header
    * I want to have a search form (submit)
    * I want a list of cars inside a card structure with their information in the button (DOMContentLoaded)
    * I want to have a drop down button that filters down to the car model 
    * I want user can like/favorite the vehicle (click)
    * I want to have a random button generator on the side
   
### Step 3 : Come up with an MVP
    * I want to have a search form (submit)
    * I want a list of cars inside a card structure with their information in the button (DOMContentLoaded)

### Step 4 : Stretch goals
