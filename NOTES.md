### Step 1 : Coming up with an idea
    * When shopping for a new car there are plenty of options to choose from.
    * As a person that is interested on new tech and cars, I want to have the user to get informations about the Electric vehicles and their qualities 
    * I want the user to also have the chance to randomly pick a car incase they could not choose which car to test drive 

### Step 2: Features
    * I want to have a title in the header
    * I want to have a random button generator on the side
    * I want a list of cars inside a card structure 
        and can also take user information so that they can book the test drive (DOMContentLoaded)
    * I want to have a search form (submit)
    * I want to have a drop down button that filters down to the car model 
    * I want user can like/favorite the vehicle (click)
    
### Step 3 : Come up with an MVP
    * I want a list of cars inside a card structure (DOMContentLoaded)
    * I want to take user information into a form so that they can book the test drive 
    * I want to have a random button generator that would pick a random car for the user 
    * I want to an alert to show up when form is submitted or is incomplete 

### Step 4 : Stretch goals
    * I want to have a drop down button that filters down to the car model 
    * I want user can like/favorite the vehicle (click)
    * Add form for user to submit a test drive request to their email at certain date
