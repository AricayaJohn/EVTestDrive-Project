# Electric Car Website Project 
As someone interested in new technology and cars, I want users of this website to get information about electric vehicles and their qualities.

Since in today's world there is a plethora of options to choose from, I want to give users the option to randomly select a car they can test drive.

I want this site to provide easy accessibility for booking a test drive when customers find the car they want.
